            Primarily wrote in client side JavaScript to sustain and add
            features to the Energy Manager web app.I also wrote C# on WCF for
            the existing back end and dotnet core 3.1 for newer integration
            projects. Since Energy Manager is stored proc heavy, I wrote and
            debugged several stored procs with an eye on performance.

            My time at NET was spent designing the testing framework that was
            used to test the company's web app. Part of my time was also used to
            research performance issues and profile them to find root cause as
            well as to fix the issues found. There had been sever issues that
            had not been addressed before which had been going on for years
            which I managed to get under control. This allowed the system to be
            useable for the life of its usage rather than having to refresh
            after a few hours of use.
          </p>
          <li>
            Increased the web app performance by %100 and decreased memory usage
            by half.

            Managed data and helped in the migration of JCPenney’s software

          <li>wrote a front end to review visual regressions</li>

            Wrote a testing framework with thousands of test cases covering both
            front and back end.

            I spent half my time on calls and half my time setting up hardware.
            When clients had no internet and their systems were down, I
            patiently walked them through setting up servers and transferring
            data from dead/no boot scenarios. On the hardware side, I built
            computers and troubleshooted hardware issues from simple
            configuration problems to capacitor failures.
